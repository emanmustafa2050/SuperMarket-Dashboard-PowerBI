# SuperMarket-Dashboard-PowerBI
Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing supermarket sales to uncover key insights and metrics. The primary objectives include:
Identifying the highest-spending customers.
Highlighting the most active days for orders.
Calculating essential metrics such as average sales and taxes.
The findings from this analysis are designed to aid in strategizing for improved sales performance and customer loyalty.

What Did I Do?

1. Data Understanding and Cleaning After exploring the dataset, I began by cleaning the data. Fortunately, the dataset was semi-cleaned, requiring only:

- Removal of duplicate rows to ensure data consistency.
- Adjusting data types to facilitate accurate analysis.

And that's it! A quick yet vital step to ensure reliable results. ðŸ˜‚ðŸ‘¾

2. Key Insights

- Top 5 Customers: The highest spenders include "Jennifer Davis," "Michael Johnson," and others, contributing a total sales figure of $583.51.
- Bottom 5 Customers: These are the least active spenders, a valuable insight to target and motivate this group.

- Active Days  : Thursday and Saturday emerged as the most active days for orders, providing guidance for resource allocation and marketing efforts.

3. Calculated Metrics (DAX Measures)

- verage Daily Sales (AvgSales): Approximately $155.07.
- Total Sales (TotalSales): $10.86K.
- Average Order Delivery Time (AvgDuration): 3 days.
- Average Taxes (AvgTaxes): $14.10.
- Total Sales Without Taxes (Sum of Retail Price): $5.91K.

4. Interactive Features
   
To enhance usability, I implemented:
Slicers for interactive filtering:
- Day-Of-Order: Filter data by specific days of the week.
- Order Date: Filter data by specific time periods, e.g., from 1/1/2024 to 14/1/2024.

Dashboard
An interactive and dynamic dashboard was created to visualize these insights clearly and effectively.

Key Takeaways : 

Using this analysis, better strategies can be developed to:
- Boost sales performance on high-activity days.
- Focus on retaining high-value customers.
- Engage with low-activity customers to increase loyalty and spending.
